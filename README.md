# 2d-Physics-Engine

This is a game built arround the concept of a Physics Engine, created by us.

The game features 2 characters, the objective of each characters is to shoot and kill the other.
The characters switch after shooting.
Each character can choose between 2 weapons, Grenade and Rocket.

GRENADE	explodes after a few seconds and has a small radius of explosion.
ROCKET	explodes on contact or after a long time, has a big explosion radius and more damage.

Forces applied to the objects of the scene:
- Gravity
- Impulsive (applied to ROCKET after pressing F)
- Buoyancy (applied inside water)
- Drag (in air and water)

- RIGHT (increase shooting velocity)
- LEFT (decrease shooting velocity)

- 2 (switch to player 2)
- 3 (switch between 60fps and 30fps)
- I (switch between integrators [verlet, forwards euler, backwards euler])
- P (stop current elements physics)
- LEFT PURPLE BUTTONS (increase and decrease Y gravity)
- RIGHT PURPLE BUTTONS (increase and decrease X wind)
